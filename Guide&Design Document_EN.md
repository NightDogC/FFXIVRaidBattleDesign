 0.To those who have never played FFXIV...

- This battle is designed based on an MMORPG game *Final Fantasy XIV*(FFXIV). Like most raid battles in MMORPG, it requires players to play roles as tank, DPS and healer, handling mechanics by moving and using skills properly, collaborating with each other to defeat the boss. To be more specific, tanks should attract enemies' attention and endure damage; DPS should maximize their DPS to damage the Boss; healers should keep the team alive.

- The design of raid battle in FFXIV tends to have a fixed timeline with puzzle-solving and low fault tolerance. In other words, the boss will cast specific skills at specific time. Random content exists but just a little. This means the battle mainly test the recitation of the battle process. Duty will be completed as long as players keep practicing.
- This raid battle design contains random content to some extent. Handle it carefully. </font>

## 1.Basic Instruction ##


1. Click Start/Pause to play after choosing a role. Use arrow keys or WASD to move. Use 1/2/3 or J/K/L keys to cast skills.  

- Roles unchosen will automatically play.<br>
- Players will be immediately revived after HP decrease to 0. All players' status, including HP, death count and buffs/debuffs are displayed on the upper left. The current player's buffs/debuffs are also displayed on the lower right.

- The battlefield is a circle with a radius of 20 meters. Players cannot cross the boundary of the field and will not die if they touch the boundary.
- In this document, all percentage player damage introduced is based on DPS and healer's HP. Tanks have additional HP and damage reduction. There is a 5% fluctuation in damage, and 100% HP damage does not necessarily mean death.

- Currently only Ranged DPS 2 can be controlled. The way to maximize DPS is using skills by 1-1-1-3-2 first and then continuously loop 1-1-3-2.
## 2.Core Mechanics ##
The core mechanic in this battle is the management of the buff <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> that the boss will inflict players. This buff will last 60 seconds.
   > <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" >: Conductive matter clings to your person. Next lightning attack will be redirected and grants you the effect of Surge Protection.

 - If an AOE attack hit a player holding this buff, the range of the AOE attack will be changed. Generally, the original dangerous area will be safe and vice versa. 
 
- If there is another player with the buff in the changed AOE attack range, the range of the AOE attack will change to the original range again. If more players holding the buff are in the corresponding range, the range of this AOE attack will be reversed multiple times.
- After successfully reversing an AOE attack, the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> will be consumed and transformed into a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" />. If multiple <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> holders are in the same AOE attack range, only one <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> will be consumed.
><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" >: Your body is covered in conductive matter, reducing the damage of lightning attacks.

- The duration of the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> is very short, but it can greatly reduce the damage of the AOE attack. It is usually used to keep players who participate in reverse AOE attack in a row alive.

- If a player is granted a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> when holding a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> , the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> will be covered by the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
- Now turn to the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />. If a player who holds a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> is granted another one, then the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> will be transformed into a debuff <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" >: Excess electricity is stored within your body, causing lightning damage over time.

- This debuff will cause damage over time, losing around 60% HP(for DPS and healer) every 3 seconds, which exceed healers' capability.
- Players can also be granted the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> and the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> when holding this debuff.
- There are some other ways may cause this debuff.

Conclusion:

- When no buffs/debuffs: can be granted the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> and the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
- When holding a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> , Being granted another <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> will lead to transforming it into a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" />; redirecting AOE attack will lead to transforming it into a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
- When holding a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, being granted a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> will leads to transforming the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> into a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
- <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> and <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> can coexist; <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> and <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CR7F.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> can coexist. Being granted another <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> when there is already one will refresh its duration.
- All buffs/debuffs will be removed when the player dies.


In addition, the boss also can have these two buffs: <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iZVO.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> and <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Ps4H.png" width = "20" height = "25" />
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iZVO.png" width = "20" height = "25" >: Damage dealt is increased while damage taken is reduced.


- <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iZVO.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> can be stacked with a maximum of 8, each stack of a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iZVO.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> will grants the boss 5% damage dealt increase and 5% damage taken decrease. This buff cannot be removed.
- Each player's death will stack one <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iZVO.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> to the boss, some specific mechanics may also stack one.
- <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Ps4H.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> is combined with a specific mechanic. See section 3.3 for its introduction.
## 3.Main Mechanics ##

###3.1 Unstable Voltage###
* The boss randomly chooses players. After 3 seconds of casting, the boss does 50% HP damage and inflicts <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s to chosen players.
* The boss will mark players <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Pt3R.png" width = "15" height = "25" /> as hints when casting.
### 3.2 Thunder Strike/ Thunder Roll
- The boss will randomly choose one of these two skills. After 3 seconds of casting, Thunder Strike does 100% HP AOE damage within 10 meters of the boss, and the Thunder Roll does 100% HP AOE damage to players 10 meters away from the boss. There is no omen when casting.
- These two skills can be converted mutually by the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />. That is, Thunder Strike can be converted to Thunder Roll by the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, and vice versa.
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Pdu6.png" width = "200" height = "200" />      <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02PwDK.png" width = "200" height = "200" />　　　       Thunder Strike 　　　　　　　　Thunder Roll
###3.3 Absorb and Lightning Surge###
- These two skills are combined into a detection mechanic, which requires that players cannot hold any <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
- After 2 seconds of casting Absorb, the boss will remove all players' <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s. If one or more <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s are successfully removed, the boss will grant itself a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Ps4H.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Ps4H.png" width = "20" height = "25" >: Gorged on lightning, Next Lightning Surge will release excessive electric.

- Lightning Surge is usually next to Absorb. After 3 seconds of casting, Lightning Surge causes damage of 66% HP to all players. If the boss hold a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Ps4H.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, the boss will remove its <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Ps4H.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> and inflict all players a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, which means team wipe.
### 3.4 Judgment Blow and Step Volage###
- These two skills are combined into a tankburst skill, and are also related to the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
- After 4 seconds of casting of Judgment Blow, the boss causes heavy damage to the main tank(i.e. the tank with #1 aggro) and inflicts the main tank a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
- One second after the end of Judgment Blow casting, the boss will cleave named Step Voltage in the direction of the main tank with a huge range that covers half of the court. The cleave can be converted to the opposite by the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02PfDf.png" width = "200" height = "200" />　　   　   Step Voltage
###3.5 Double Strike/ Double Roll###
- Double means the boss will use Thunder Strike and Thunder Roll in a row.
- After 3 seconds of casting of Double Strike, Thunder Strike will be cast first, and after another 2 seconds, Thunder Roll will be cast.
- After 3 seconds of casting of Double Roll, Thunder Roll will be cast first, and after another 2 seconds, Thunder Strike will be cast.

###3.6 Cloudstorm###
- When the boss starts casting Cloudstorm, two thundercloud omens appear at (0,17.3), (17.3,0) or (0,-17.3), (-17.3,0) on the court. After 4 seconds  ofcasting, thunderclouds will generate a circular damage area with a radius of 10 meters where it is located. These damage areas will inflict players who enter the area a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" />. The thunderclouds will last 60 seconds.
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02PxVU.png" width = "200" height = "200" /> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02PzaF.png" width = "200" height = "200" />
> 　　Thunderclouds' omen　　　　  　          　Damage areas

###3.7 Echo Summon
- The boss will summon 5 Echos on the outside of the court at 8 clock positions, which are 0, 3, 6, 9, 1:30, 4:30, 7:30 and 10：30. Echo cannot be targeted and will cast Charge and Hypercharge.
- No casting time for Echo Summon, but the boss will quote *Come forth, the echo of storming thunder!* as a hint.
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iKGd.png" width = "220" height = "200" />
> Echos randomly are spawned at 5 of 8 clock positions
####3.7.1 Charge###
- 5 seconds after Echos spawned, tethers extend from Echos to the boss. This tether can be intercepted by players.
- 6 seconds after tether appear, if the target is a player, it will grant the player a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, and if the target is the boss, it will grant the boss <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iZVO.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iYdS.png" width = "220" height = "200" />
> Charge and intercepting the tether
####3.7.2 Hypercharge###
- 11 seconds after Echos spawned, one of 5 Echos readies to cast Hypercharge. There will be a visual effect on it.
- 3 seconds after ready, one Echo casts towards the boss with a linear AOE damage with 12 meters width and length that covers the field. The AOE can be redirected by <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, and the AOE range will become two linear range on both side of the original range, also with 12 meters width and length that covers the field.
- Players will take 150% HP damage if they are hit by Hypercharge. Boss will be granted a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02Ps4H.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> if it is hit by Hypercharge, so Hypercharge must be redirected by odd numbers of times of <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s.
> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iwzn.png" width = "220" height = "200"> <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02iDs0.png" width = "220" height = "200">

>　　　Hypercharge omen　　　　　　　　Original Hypercharge　　　　　Redirected Hypercharge
###3.8 Thunderstorm###
- After 3 seconds of casting of Thunderstorm, circular grounded AOE omens with a radius of 5 meters will appear at each player's position. 3 seconds after omens appear, a player takes 66% HP damage if he/she stand in the range of AOE. Each AOE counts damage independently.
- If an AOE redirected by <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> the range will become a ring like a donut with an outer circle of 10 meters and an inner circle of 5 meters. Each AOE also counts <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> independently. That is, if a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> holder enters multiple AOE ranges, only one AOE will be redirected and consume the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, and the remaining AOEs will still keep the original range and hit the player.
- Normally it is recommended that players stack to reduce the coverage of thunderstorm AOEs. If you need consume <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> through Thunderstorm, see the following figures.

<img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02gGod.png" width = "200" height = "200">

>Consuming one <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> through thunderstorm: stand as shown in the left figure before omens appear, and move to the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> holder's thunderstorm range after the omen appears.

>Consuming more <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> through thunderstorm: other players need to move to the overlapping area of <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> holders' thunderstorm range.
### 3.9 Lance Summon ###
-  2 seconds after the boss quote *The Levinlance shall strike you down!*, the boss will summon a lance randomly at one of 3,6,9,12 clock positions on the outside of the field, and then summon other two lances every 1.5 seconds in 120 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.

- 5 seconds after a lance spawned, the lance casts a non-omen linear range AOE damage in the direction of the center of the field without omen. Its width is 34.6 meters and its length covers the entire field. A player will take 900% HP damage if hit by this AOE.
The AOE range will become the range of minor circular segments on both sides of the field after redirected by <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />.

- This is also a mechanic that checks the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, which requires players to hold one <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> at least. See figures for method.
><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02hLLV.png" width = "200" height = "200"/>
>　Original range of Lance AOE

> The steps are as follows: Firstly move to the edge of the field that is perpendicular to the first lance; Next move to clockwise or counterclockwise (same as how lances are spawned) direction of the remaining lances to dodge the third lance's AOE attack after the first lance cast AOE attack. The <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> ensures that the second lance's attack can be ignored.

##5.Some combo mechanics guide##
As only Ranged DPS 2 can be controlled currently, the following guide will focus on the Ranged DPS 2. 

If you don't need to know principles but only know the method for mechanics, just look at the bold text.
###5.1 At 0013, Thunder Strike/Thunder Roll with 3 <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s###
* As there will be Abosrb which requires no <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> next, so you need to make sure that Thunder Strike/Thunder Roll consumes all 3 <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s.
* It can be inferred that one <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> holder should dodge the original damage area, and 2 <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> holders enter the original damage area. Players without the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> also enter the original damage area
* **In this case, Ranged DPS 2 has the highest priority of leaving the original damage area, which means Ranged DPS 2 should dodge the original damage area when has a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, otherwise enter the original damage area.**
### 5.1 At 0041, Judgment Blow and Step Voltage###
- Judgment Blow grants main tank a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />. It is recommended that two tanks do not swap the main tank, so the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />  will be consumed by Step Voltage, **All players should come to the side of the main tank to dodge the redirected Step Voltage.**
- Although this <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> can be consumed later, but next Unstable Voltage may mark the main tank and grants the main tank another <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> causing <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, so try to avoid it.
###5.2 At 0063, Thunderstorm and Echo Summon###
- Previous Unstable Voltage and Echos' Charge can grants players 9 <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s in total, which means that there must be a player being granted two <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s causing <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CjtH.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> unless players consume <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s via Thunderstorm. At the same time, Hypercharge requires odd numbers of <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s, so 2 <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s should be consumed (Consumption of 4 is acceptable but will result in a very extreme safe area).
* **First deal with Thunderstorm even if the Charge's tethers appear. At this time Ranged DPS 2 has the lowest priority of consuming the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, so stack with other players and keep away from the players who need to consume their <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s, and then move to the overlapping area of the Thunderstorm omens of the two players who need to consume the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> when Thunderstorm's omens appear. The position where other players stack is to the right or below depending on the position of Thundercloud on the field.**
* 2 seconds after Thunderstorm determined, Charge is determined. **Players without the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> need to intercept tethers. At this time, the priority of interception of Ranged DPS 2 is the first tether counting counterclockwise from 9 o'clock.** If there is any unexpected which can results in an even number of <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s after intercepting, a tether should be discarded though it will make the later combat a little bit hard.  
* After Charge tethers determined, one of Echos is readied to cast Hypercharge. Since there will be Absorb later which requires no <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, all the <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />s should be consumed by Hypercharge.
* It can be inferred that <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> holders in the original AOE range should be one more than <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> holders not in the original AOE range. For the convenience of Melee DPS, **Ranged DPS 2 has the highest priority of this mechanic: if there is a Tank or Melee DPS has no <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> and Ranged DPS 2 has one, Ranged DPS 2 should enter the AOE range, otherwise should dodge.**
###5.3 From the end of Echo Summon to Lance Summon###
* Lance Summon requires at least one <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, and in this phase only one Judgment Blow can grant a <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" />, so Tanks should swap the main tank when Judgment Blow casting, **and other players cannot move to the side of the main tank.** Main tank should keep <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/12/02CaTg.png" width = "20" height = "25" /> not being consumed by other mechanics.
* Handle other mechanics appropriately. Since there is still Thunderclouds in the field, so **when the first Lance spawned, players should move to the safe place where there is no Thundercloud damage area.**
